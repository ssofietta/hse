    "You can check youself with cells below. If you have written your function correct - cells with `assert`s will not raise any errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write function countlen(words), has list of strings as input. Function returns dictionary: keys - strings from words, values â€” their length in symbols. For example, countlen(['hello', 'world!']) returns {'hello':5, 'world!':6}.\n",
    "2. Write function `fdict(d)`, which has dictionary `d` as input. The function returns the list, where keys and values from `d` are in the order such `[key1, value1, key2, value2]`. For example, `fdict({'Alice': 1, 'Bob': 2})` can return the list `['Alice', 1, 'Bob', 2]` or list `['Bob', 2, 'Alice', 1]`.\n",
    "3. Write function stats(words), has list of strings as input. Function returns the most frequent word (if there are several words - return all in list). For example, stats([\"qqq\", \"hello\", \"hello\", \"world\"]) returns \"hello\"; stats([\"qqq\", \"a\", \"b\", \"b\", \"a\", \"c\"]) returns ['a', 'b'].\n",
    "4. Write the function in list comprehension form which takes `dict` object as the first argument and the `list` of values as the second and returns the list with all keys (connected with these values) [example approach](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-get-key-from-value-in-dictionary/)."
