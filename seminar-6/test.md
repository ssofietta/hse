If the answer on the particular question in the Test is not full \(not all requirements of the task are done\), then the student gets 0 \(zero\) points for such a task/question. Moreover, the cheating is strongly prohibited during the Test \(use of mobile devices, the Internet/LAN connection, talking with the other students and looking at the other screen or paper\). In case of cheating - the student gets 0 \(zero\) points for the whole Test.
