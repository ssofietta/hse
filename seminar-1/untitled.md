>
> $$NPV=-Investments+\sum_{i=1}^{n}{\frac{CF_i}{(1+Rate)^i}} $$ 
>
> $NPV=-Investments+\sum\_{i=1}^{n}{\frac{CF\_i}{\(1+Rate\)^i}}$

## Task 2

### Maximize Stock Profit

> You will be given a list of stock prices for a given day and your goal is to return the maximum profit \(minimum loss\) that could have been made by buying a stock at the given price and then selling the stock later on. For example, if the input is: \[45, 24, 35, 31, 40, 38, 11\] then your program should return 16 because if you bought the stock at $24 and sold it at $40, a profit of $16 was made and this is the largest profit that could be made.
