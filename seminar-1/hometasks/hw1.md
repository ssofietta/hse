# HW1

{% hint style="info" %}
## **Homework 1 \(Grading\)**

![](../../.gitbook/assets/stepik_logotype.png) The [link for Homework1 on Stepik](https://stepik.org/invitation/03f239275d80c29d488837e240fc07bf5954090d/)

1. Please, register and sign-in with your corporate e-mail \(ended with `@edu.hse.ru`\).
2. Fill-in your valid name and surname in your Stepik profile.
3. For the current HW and for the following HomeTasks use only this profile \(multiple submissions from several accounts will not be assessed\). Moreover, you will be provided with the particular variant of HomeTask in future automatically \(the appropriate tasks will be stored in your own Stepik Account\).
4. While you will solve tasks, change only lines with comments I provided in templates for each task \(phrases like `#YOUR CODE` and `#YOUR RESULT`\). The rest of the lines are used in order to help you in obtaining input data and providing correct output.
5. Solve your tasks in Python 3 language.
6. Each tasks' weight is 1 point \(10 tasks in total\). If your code for particular task works without errors and provides correct output - you automatically obtain 1 point.
7. In this HW you will be restricted with the number of submissions for your code \(just **ONE** attempt\). So, firstly, I recommend you to solve your tasks locally on your own computer, test them \(with several examples\), and, finally, submit to Stepik system.
8. If you're not sure about the submission process, please solve and submit tasks for 1st Seminar assignments \(there you are not limited with the number of submission attempts\).
9. For the first time, we are also in process of testing of the embedded plagiarism system. So, if you submit this HW in time \(before Hard Deadline\): the plagiarism will be neglected. However, if you will submit your tasks after the Hard Deadline \(and before Soft Deadline\) - such tasks will be compared with previous submissions of the other students and penalized if the Stepik system will detect plagiarism.
10. _Remark_: HW consists of 10 independent tasks, but the Hard and Soft Deadlines \(and plagiarism check\) affects the whole submission. For example, if you solve 9 tasks out of ten before Hard Deadline, and, then solve the last task after Hard Deadline \(and before Soft Deadline\) - the whole your work will be penalized with 25% \(so instead of 9 you will be given with 8 grade\). So, take this fact into account.
