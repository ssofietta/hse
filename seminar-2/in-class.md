## Problem

> Suppose you have obtained headings of news from Financial world. The goal is to get several hot topics for specific period of time for the further analysis. Precisely, calculate words' frequencies for specified period.
>
> 1. You have ["Daily News for Stock Market" \(RedditNews\) dataset](https://query.data.world/s/ghrtsvkjjy26hpojr3qi2zkbska4sr)
> 2. Load the file
> 3. Restore news for 2015 in separate list object
> 4. Lowercase all letters
> 5. Split words by spaces
> 6. Calculate words' frequencies
> 7. Provide TOP-50 words
>
> Think about removal of additional symbols, [lemmatization and stemming process](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/stemming-lemmatization-python), stopwords removal, [analysis combinations of words](https://towardsdatascience.com/from-dataframe-to-n-grams-e34e29df3460).
